## Connection to Notion
Please contact a colleague from Helical to get the access token for Notion.
Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of this repo and paste the token inside that file like so:
```
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_******
```
The file is not tracked by default but please always double check to no commit a token!
