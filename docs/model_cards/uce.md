# Model Card for Universal Cell Embedding (UCE)

## Model Details

**Model Name:** Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) \
**Model Version:** 1.0 \
**Model Description:** A large-scale self-supervised transformer-based model, pre-trained across more than 36 million cells for creating universal representations of cell types across different species and tissues. The model enables cell type annotation prediction, hypothesis generation, disease state comparison, new data mapping, integration of diverse single-cell datasets, and opens the door for discovery of novel cell type functions.

## Model Developers

**Developed By:** Yanay Rosen and Yusuf Roohani conceived the study, performed research, contributed to new analytical tools, designed algorithmic frameworks, analyzed data, performed experiments and developed the software. Other [author contributions](#citation). \

## Model Type

**Architecture:** Transformer-based \
**Domain:** Cell Biology, Bioinformatics \
**Input Data:** Single-cell transcriptomics data \

## Model Purpose

**Technical usage:**
- Tokenizing genes corresponding to its protein product
- Pre-training
- Running in Zero-shot setting  
- Extracting and plotting cell embeddings

**Broader research applications:**  
- Designed to address questions in cell and molecular biology
- Generation of representations of new single-cell expression datasets with no model fine-tuning or retraining while still remaining robust to dataset and batch-specific artifacts
- Cell type prediction in large single-cell datasets with no additional model retraining
- Mapping of new data into a universal embedding space that aligns cell types across tissues and species
- Hypothesis generation in biological research
- Novel cross-dataset discoveries

## Training Data

**Data Sources:**  
- Public single-cell transcriptomic datasets (e.g., CellXGene, various GEO datasets)
- Data from multiple species (including humans, mice, lemurs, zebrafish, pigs, monkeys, and frogs) and tissues to ensure diversity
- Download the full list of datasets used to train UCE [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/11/29/2023.11.28.568918/DC3/embed/media-3.xlsx?download=true) 

**Data Volume:**  
- Trained across more than 300 datasets consisting of over 36 million cells and more than 1,000 different cell types

**Preprocessing:**  
- Standardized to remove low-quality data
- Balanced to ensure representation across species and cell types


## Model Performance

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- Zero-shot embedding quality and clustering using metrics from the [single-cell integration benchmark](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01336-8)
- Cell type organization
- Comparison to cell ontology
- Zero-shot cell type alignment to Integrated Mega-scale Atlas 

**Testing Data:**  
- Held-out subsets of training datasets
- External validation using diverse single-cell datasets

## Ethical Considerations

**Bias and Fairness:**  
- Inclusion of diverse species and cell types to minimize bias
- Continuous evaluation for potential biases

**Privacy:**  
- Training data sourced from public datasets with appropriate usage permissions
- No private or sensitive genetic data used without consent

**Mitigations:**  
- Regular audits to identify and address biases
- Collaboration with ethicists and domain experts

## Model Limitations

**Known Limitations:**  
- Analyses and corresponding benchmarks are generally limited by their emphasis on broad, coarse-grained cell type labels
- Current scRNA-seq foundation models, including UCE, do not utilize the detailed information contained in the raw RNA transcripts

**Future Improvements:**  
- New analyses and benchmarks should focus on more detailed, fine-grained cell type classifications
- Incorporation of genomic precision at the transcript level
- Simulation of the biological processes of cells, leading to the creation of "Virtual Cells"

## How to Use

**Input Format:**  
- Single-cell transcriptomics data in appropriate formats (e.g., h5ad)

**Output Format:**  
- JSON or h5ad format with cell type annotations and embeddings

**Example Usage:**
```python
from helical.models.uce.model import UCE, UCEConfig
import anndata as ad

configurer=UCEConfig(batch_size=10)
uce = UCE(configurer=configurer)
ann_data = ad.read_h5ad("dataset.h5ad")
data_loader = uce.process_data(ann_data[:10])
embeddings = uce.get_embeddings(data_loader)

print(embeddings.shape)
```
